## more_cosmetics

Adds the ability to add custom cosmetics to Ultrapool :3 

To use the mod, create a folder `kyfex-more_cosmetics` right beside Ultrapool. Inside that folder, create 4 more: `color`, `floor`, `table`, and `wall`. 
Inside the last three (not `color`), you can place textures that will appear in their respective categories. In the `color` folder, place text files that have a color on each line, and 5 colors total.
When restarting the game, you should be able to see your new cosmetics :3
